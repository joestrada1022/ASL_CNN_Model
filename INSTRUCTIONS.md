# Instructions for Running the Notebook for Testing the Model

1. **Initialize the Notebook**

- run the initialization cell to import all necessary libraries

2. **Load LabelBinarizer**
- navigate to Dataset Handling -> Scaling/Reshaping the Dataset
- run everything under that heading

3. **Load Model**
- there are two sections for the model. One for the ANN and one for the CNN.
- in the specific section, navigate to after the cell where the model is training (the one with the epochs)
- there should be a cell with google drive download links and a model load function.
- run that cell

4. **Run live video**
 - in the Live Video Input section, run everything under 'helper functions'
